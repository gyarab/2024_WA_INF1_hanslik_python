If you’re caught, you join the horde. However, some kids playing the game claim to have found a way to cheat and easily “tag” opponents.\r\n\r\nOver the past year, teenagers have produced video tutorials showing how to side-load a virtual private network (VPN) onto Meta’s virtual reality headsets and use the location-changing technology to get ahead in the game. Using a VPN, according to the tutorials, introduces a delay that makes it easier to sneak up and tag other players.\r\n\r\nWhile the workaround is likely to be an annoying but relatively harmless bit of in-game cheating, there’s a catch. The free VPN app that the video tutorials point to, Big Mama VPN, is also selling access to its users’ home internet connections—with buyers essentially piggybacking on the VR headset’s IP address to hide their own online activity.\r\n\r\nThis technique of rerouting traffic, which is best known as a residential proxy and more commonly happens through phones, has become increasingly popular with cybercriminals who use proxy networks to conduct cyberattacks and use botnets. While the Big Mama VPN works as it is supposed to, the company’s associated proxy services have been heavily touted on cybercrime forums and publicly linked to at least one cyberattack.", "date_posted": "2025-02-22T17:26:34Z", "image": "", "category": 4, "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaLp6BIkgo&t", "authors": [1]}}]
